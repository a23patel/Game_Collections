<h2> Description </h2>
 
 <p>Game Central is a C++ program that features a menu of four games: <b>Hi-Lo guessing game, Magic 8-ball, Palindrome, and Rock/Paper/Scissors and Tic Tac Toe game.</b></p>

<h4>Hi-Lo Guessing Game</h4>
<li>A number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a range of numbers. The program provides hints to the user if the guess is higher or lower than the number.</li>

<h4>Magic 8-ball</h4>
<li>A game where the user asks a question, and the program provides a random response from a set of possible answers.</li>

<h4>Palindrome</h4>
<li>A game where the user inputs a word or phrase, and the program checks if it is a palindrome (a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward).</li>

<h4>Rock/Paper/Scissors </h4>
<li>A game where the user plays against the computer by selecting either rock, paper, or scissors.</li>

<h4>Tic Tac Toe </h4>
<li>A game that involves a 3x3 grid where the user and computer take turns placing their respective symbols. It is similar to Rock/Paper/Scissors in terms of gameplay, and the objective is to get three symbols in a row to win the game.</li>
